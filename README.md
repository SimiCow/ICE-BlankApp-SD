The setup steps were simple to follow and I had no problem with it. I only encountered an error when trying to push my app to github. I eventually figured out that the problem was occuring due to there being a submodule inside the respository. 
This was because the folder called first ice task which contained the project files were nested in another folder called ice task 1.

Here are the screenshots of my working app.
